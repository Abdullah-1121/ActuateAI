# Core Concepts of Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

This section covers the fundamental concepts that underpin physical AI and humanoid robotics.

## What is Physical AI?

Physical AI refers to artificial intelligence systems that interact with and operate within the physical world. Unlike traditional AI that operates primarily in digital spaces, physical AI must account for real-world physics, sensorimotor coordination, and environmental dynamics.

## Humanoid Robotics

Humanoid robotics focuses on creating robots with human-like form and capabilities. These robots often feature:

- Bipedal locomotion systems
- Human-like manipulation capabilities
- Social interaction abilities
- Biomimetic design principles

## Key Principles

### Embodied Cognition

The idea that intelligence emerges from the interaction between an agent and its environment. In humanoid robotics, this means that the robot's physical form influences its cognitive processes.

### Sensorimotor Integration

The seamless coordination between sensory input and motor output that allows humanoid robots to interact effectively with their environment.

### Adaptive Control Systems

Control systems that can adapt to changing environmental conditions and learn from experience to improve performance over time.
